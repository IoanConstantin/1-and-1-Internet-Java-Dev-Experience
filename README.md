I was part of an Agile team, the Shops & Offers team (in the Mail & Media department). The team comprised 1 manager, 1 product owner, 5 developers and 4 QA engineers.
When a non-technical issue regarding a new functionality occurred after the planning meeting I spoke with the product owner or with the business employees from Germany.

At 1&1 Internet Development I used the following technologies: Java 8, JavaScript, SQL, HTML, CSS, Spring MVC, Spring Boot, REST API, Git, Maven, Tomcat, Mockito (in some cases
we needed to mock the products because some external services were down and the products details were unavailable) and I also learned more about sessions, caches, tracking 
pixels and marketing campaigns.

I worked on 2 projects called Customer Self Care and Access and I will describe below 2 tasks that I have worked on: 
1. Replacing request scoped beans with session scoped beans in order to improve the security of the Customer Self Care application (refactoring the application).
2. Modifying the invoice payment flow (adding other products or classes of products with different attributes and modifying the tracking pixels or the checkout pages).
